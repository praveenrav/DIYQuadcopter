# DIYQuadcopter

This Arduino C++ code was created to be uploaded to an Arduino Nano 33 IoT.

It showcases an (albeit ultimately ineffective) attempt to control a quadcopter drone featuring 4 brushless DC motors using PID control.

Additionally, the code is able to harness the IoT capabilities of the Arduino Nano 33 IoT and receive and transmit commands/information from a custom UI via the Blynk app.
